# Sublet

Welcome to the official home of the Sublet app! Our application is an open-source project meant to connect all sides involved in a sublet deal.

### What is a sublet?

A sublet is a lease of a temporarily vacant property. A most frequent example for a sublet deal would be an owner traveling for a short expedition, such as a vacation or bussiness trip, and not willing to leave their property unoccupied, leasing it to a willing renter. This method of temporary housing is very popular in isreal, but can only be found in close friend groups or dedicated forums on social media. Our application is here to fix that, and offer a true home for any and all sublet deals.

### What makes our application different than other solutions?

While other popular solutions for subletting act as mediators between a landlord and renter, we focus on short-time sublets, with the important distinction between landlord and host, and renter and owner. The main goal of our app is to offer a place for spontaneous travelers to house their property to any apertment-seeking person of their choice.

## About our code

Our application uses the Google framworks Flutter and Firebase, to have the best connection of the front and back end of the project. Flutter is a relatively new framework offered by Google to develop applications using a single codebase. Since its inception, Flutter was meant to work as a front end to applications using Firebase, and so the connection between the two frameworks is as close to optimal as is achievable.
